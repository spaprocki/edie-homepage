Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

During completing this challenge I've decided to use another method of styling html elements. In previous challenges I started with assigning IDs and classes to HTML elements and the adding style to those selectors.

In this challenge I started with creating CSS variables, and them using them in a general class e.g.:

```
  .text-red {
    color: var(--red);
  }
```

After creating a number of such classes, I would apply them to selected HTML elements, e.g.:

```
  <h1 class="font-24 desktop-font-48 text-gray-1 font-medium margin-40 desktop-margin-277">
```

This method worked well for some of the properties, that were applied repeatedly to many elements of the HTML file. Nevertheless I still had to apply IDs to some elements, which properties velues were exclusive to them only (e.g. margins).
